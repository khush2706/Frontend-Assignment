## Project Description:
  The goal of this application is to create a React application that converts a json UI schema into a form component and render it live on the screen.
  The React application will have two main components: the JSON editor component and the form preview component. 
  The JSON editor component will allow users to paste the UI-Schema in JSON format on the left-hand side. The form preview component will automatically render the form based on the pasted UI-Schema and display it on the right-hand side.
